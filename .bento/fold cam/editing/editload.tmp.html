<p>The <strong>Loading</strong> operation for an automated panel-bender (like the TBC-7030 or the TBC-7020)
can be edited by clicking twice on the <em>loading</em> cell in the navigator on the top. This
is the cell labelled <strong>L</strong>. The first click selects the load operation, and the second click
brings up the load panel.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Centering angle</strong> setting specifies the part orientation during the centering
operation. Note that this is the side facing into the machine, and is therefore
exactly opposite to the side actually referencing the front gauges. In this example,
the side C2 faces into the machine (and the side C1 at +90 degrees is used for gauging).
This setting displays a list of orientations that are suitable for the initial
centering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Part Pickup</strong> selector lets you choose if the part is picked up using the vacuum
suction cups or using the rear pliers. (This is displayed only if both choices are
available. Some parts will be too small to be picked up by the vacuum gripper, and
some parts will be too large to be picked up by the rear pliers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Simulate</strong> slider at the bottom can be used to simulate the different steps of
the initial centering process.</p>

<h3 id="_gauging_section">Gauging section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This collapsible section lets you cycle through various gauge placements.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Auto-Place</strong> setting can be used to switch between different gauge placements.
Depending on the part geometry, there could be multiple locations on the edge of the
part where various types of corner or notched gauging could be done. Clicking this
button repeatedly will cycle through all these options. (As you do this, you will
note the actual gauge positions getting updated in the <em>Fine Position</em> section).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Slack</strong> setting is used to add an additional gap (in the Z direction) between
the gauges. It can be used to facilitate gauging in the case of parts that may not
be trimmed exactly to size.</p>

<h3 id="_handling_section">Handling section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section sets up the rotation position and other handling options during the
centering cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Rotor (Z, X)</strong> settings control the rotor position (position of the rotation center),
and these are measured relative to the part center in the centering orientation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on <strong>Propagate</strong> to use the same rotation center for processing all the sides.
Typically, JFY Bend will try to optimize the rotation centers to minimize the number of
double-rotations required. However, if you manually adjust the rotation center using the
setting above, you could use this to button to try further optimization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Speed %</strong> setting controls the rotation speed (as a percentage of the maximum
possible speed).<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>

<h3 id="_fine_position_section">Fine Position section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This collapsible section lets you edit the gauge positions manually. Typically this
should be rarely required - most of the time, the initial selection of gauging position
is optimal. And in other situations, a few clicks of the <strong>Auto Place</strong> button mentioned
above should position the gauges correctly. The <strong>Fine Position</strong> settings are only for
those rare cases or unusual geometry where JFY Bend cannot find any gauging solutions.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Left (Z, X)</strong> settings let you control the position of the left gauge. The Z
position is measured from the center-line, while the X position is measured from
the edge of the part in the X direction. As you adjust this setting, the gauges
move, and you may see collisions, or <em>gauge-not-engaged</em> errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Right (Z, X)</strong> settings control the position of the right gauge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Trimmed</strong> indication in the display switches between Trimmed, Untrimmed, or
Diagonal to indicate the type of gauging in effect</p>

<p>For a 7030 equipped with a KB40, there are more options available during the loading:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Stack angle</strong> setting to select a particular orientation of the part on the
KB40 pallet. You can then set up the loading mode (front or back) and the centering
angle for that particular stack angle. The NC code (XML) generated by JFY Bend has the
centering settings for each of the various stack angles embedded in it. Depending
on the actual stack angle, the appropriate setting is used. You can inspect all the
stack angles that are programmed by pointing at the <strong>Gauging</strong> cell:<br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/kb40-stacks.png" alt="KB40 Stacks" width="386"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Loading mode</strong> setting is used to select between <em>Back centering</em> and the
<em>Front centering</em> modes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Centering angle</strong> setting is used to select the orientation of the part during
the initial centering. If the loading mode is set to <em>front centering</em>, then the
centering angle is the same as the stack angle (since no rotation is done before
the part is pushed against the front gauges). If the loading mode is set to
<em>back centering</em>, then the centering angle is one of these:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <em>stack angle</em> : the part is centered first, and then pulled back and
rotated to the initial side orientation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>first side angle</em> : the part is rotated to the same orientation as the
initial side orientation before centering.</p>

<p>The <strong>Handling</strong>, <strong>Gauging</strong> and the <strong>Fine Position</strong> sections are similar to the
corresponding sections from the 7030 (see section above), except that they may
refer to the positions of the back-gauges or the front-gauges
(depending on the <em>Loading mode</em> setting).</p>

<p>The <strong>Centering Angle</strong> setting is used to select the orientation of the part during
the initial centering. This can be different from the first-side orientation - in this
case, the part is centered, then pulled back and rotated before the first side is
processed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ergo_centering_section">Ergo-Centering section</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section is used to select if <em>ergonomic centering</em> is enabled, and is then used

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the <strong>Ergonomic load</strong> setting is set to <strong>&lt;No&gt;</strong>, then no ergonomic centering happens.
The part is loaded with the gauges in the center (in processing position). If this
is set to <strong>Left</strong> or <strong>Right</strong>, then an ergonomic centering cycle is programmed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Gripping plier</strong> selects which of the two pliers is used for <em>gripping</em> the part
and pulling it to the center (the other plier is used for referencing a corner of the
part). Typically, if the ergonomic centering happens on the left side, the <em>right</em>
plier is used for gripping, and vice-versa.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Z-Right</strong> (or <strong>Z-Left</strong>) setting controls the position of this gripping plier.
As you slide it along the part, the X position of the plier is automatically adjusted
so it can grip the leading edge of the part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Regrip with both</strong> switch can be used to provide more stability during the
transport of the part to the center of the machine. If this is turned on, then the
other plier is also used to grip the part edge while it is pulled into the machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Z-Regrip</strong> setting (displayed only if the <em>Regrip with both</em> switch is on),
sets up the position of the second plier when it is gripping the part.</p>

<p>The <strong>Grip with</strong> setting is used to select whether the part is gripped with the
vacuum manipulator (X3) or with the rotary clamps (X2/X4) during the centering cycle.</p>

<li>
<p>The <strong>Rotor (Z, X)</strong> is the position of the rotary clamp (relative to the part center)
when the part is held / rotated during the centering cycle. If that side is subsequently
processed using the rotary clamp (based on the <em>Grip with</em> setting above), this is
also the position at which the clamp holds the part during the side processing.</p>
