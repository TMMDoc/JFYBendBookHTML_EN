<p>Some basic settings of a bend operation can can be edited by bring up the <strong>Bend</strong>
panel. To bring up the bend panel, use the bend navigator:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on one of the numbers in the fold navigator to switch to a bend</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <strong>again</strong> on the same number to bring up the bend panel for that bend.</p>

<p>The bend panel can be seen alongside. This has some settings and operations for
working on the bend.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Air-gap</strong> input box is used to adjust the air-gap for bending (this is the
gap between the blade and blank-holders). As the air-gap is adjusted
from its default value, the Fold Navigator will display a <em>non-standard
air-gap</em> warning. Collision checking will also be done immedaitely with
the updated air-gap and you can tune the air-gap to prevent
collisions. The bending force will also be computed, and if you set
the air-gap so low that the maximum bending force is exceeded, the
fold navigator will display this as an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>P86</strong> setting is used to control the application of additional hold-down
pressure during the bending cycle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Skip Bend</strong> button skip this bend; this bend will not be processed by
the panel-bender and needs to be processed later (possibly by a
press-brake).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>New Side</strong> button is used to split a side into two separate sides; this
appears only if you are not editing the first bend in a side. Clicking
this button splits the side at this bend, and starts a new side. There
are several reasons you may want to split a side:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The side may need to be split into two, and the part may need to be flipped
between the two sides before processing can be completed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some bends from another side may need to be completed before the remaining
bends of this side can be completed. In this case, you can split
the side, and re-sequence the sides so the bends from the other
side are inserted in between.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Prev</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> buttons are used to navigate between the different bends in
the part. (You can also use the <em>PageUp</em> and <em>PageDown</em> keys for this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Side</strong> button is used to navigate up from this bend op to the containing
side. Clicking this button displays the Bend Side panel (described
below) which can be used to perform some operations on the entire
bending side (or section).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this bend has been skipped, these settings are not displayed; there is only
an <strong>Unskip Bend</strong> button to bring the bend back into processing.</p>
