<p>Clicking on the blank-holder brings up the <strong>BH panel</strong> (blank-holder panel). The blank-holder panel
has the following settings:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Length</strong> is used to select different blank-holder composition length (this is
displayed if this side uses a split-blank holder composition).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Use ENW</strong> tool check-box is used to enable an ENW tool for processing this
bend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <strong>Use ENW</strong> tool setting is turned on, then this list can be used to select
one of the available ENW tools. This is a part-wide setting, since
different ENW tools cannot be used for different bends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Prev</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> button are used to switch between the different bends in the
part.</p>

<p>As you experiment with various ENW tools, JFY Bend will immediately compute the
collision status of that blank-holder composition for all the bends in the
part, and will update the Fold Navigator status. Thus, it is very simple
to pick a suitable ENW tool by scrolling through this list, since there is
immediate feedback on whether any bends have issues with the selected
tool.</p>
