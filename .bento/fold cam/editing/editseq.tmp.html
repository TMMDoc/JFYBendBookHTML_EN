<p>There are two ways to change the sequence in which sides are processed. One way
is to use the <strong>Edit Sequence</strong> button in the <a href="EditSide.html">Side Panel</a> as explained above.
The other simpler method is to simply drag the section to a new location
in the Fold Navigator.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on a fold number in the Fold Navigator  and drag it to change the
sequence. The side you click on defines the exact set of bends that
get dragged. Let&#8217;s consider a part like the one below, which has two
short sides and two long sides. The sequence in this case is L1 L2 C1
C2:<br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/seq1.png" alt="Seq1" width="485"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you click on one of the bends in side C1 or side L1, then the entire <em>short side</em>
or the entire set of <em>long sides</em> are being dragged. So, if you
click on the bends 1 or 2 (part of L1) or the bends 5 or 6 (part of
C1), then you are dragging 4 bends. Here is an image below showing a
drag initiated from bend 5; we are now dragging sides C1 and C2 (note
how bends 5, 6, 7 and 8 are slightly grayed out and move along with
the mouse). We can now drop this before the sides L1 and L2, thus changing the sequence to
C1 C2 L1 L2.<br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/seq2.png" alt="Seq2" width="395"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we start dragging the sides L2 or C2, then only that side gets dragged, and
we could use this to shuffle the two sides C1 and C2 or the sides L2
and L2. We could even use this to change the sequence to something
like L1 C1 C2 L2 (which will usually not work, but it may be useful in
some special cases). Here is an example where we are dragging the side
L2 (note how bends 3 and 4 are slightly grayed out, and move along
with the mouse):<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>The dragging is designed to allow the common case of swapping the long and
short sides easily (CCLL &lt;&#8594; LLCC), while still allowing changing the
order between individual sides like C1 and C2. When the sequence is
changed, JFY Bend computes updated tooling, blades, gauging etc. It is
likely that the change in sequence may now require ZBW blades, ENW
tools to be deployed (or it may cause these to be no longer required).
All these changes are automatically computed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, the sequence you select in this way may not be feasible. For
example, consider the part below, with 6 bends. The bends 1 and 2 are
composite bends made of multiple collinear segments. If we process
bends 4 or 6 first, we cannot then process bends 1 or 2, since the
individual segments will no longer be collinear.<br>

If you try to alter the sequence in such a way that you create such an
<em>impossible</em> sequence, JFY Bend will not change the sequence, but will instead
display an error:<br>
