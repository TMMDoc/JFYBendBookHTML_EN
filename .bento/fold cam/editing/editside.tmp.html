<p>There are a few settings and operations connected to an entire bending <em>side</em> (as
opposed to a single bend <em>operation</em>). These are accessed by opening the
<strong>Side Panel</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a Bend panel (by clicking twice on a number in the Fold Navigator). Then
click on the <strong>Side</strong> button to open the Side panel for the side that
contains that bend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hold down <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and click on a number in the fold navigator to open the
side panel for that side.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The side panel looks like the one shown alongside (the actual set of options
available in the Edit Sequence popup may be different, depending on the
part).</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Flip Side</strong> button to flip the entire side upside down. This will
cause the blades, blank-holders and part-handling to be recomputed
immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit Sequence</strong> button to bring up a sub-menu that shows the possibly
sequence shuffling that you could do with this side. In the picture
above, we are working with a part that has a side sequence like L1 L2
C1 C2, and we have selected the side L2. The possible sequence choices
are explained below:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>&lt;&lt; L2 earlier</strong> shifts the side L2 earlier, leading to a sequence that would be
L2 L1 C1 C2 (of course, the sides are immediately renamed after
this, so the sequence still reads L1 L2 C1 C2 when code is
generated).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>L1+L2 later &gt;&gt;</strong> shifts both L1 and L2 to happen after C1 and C2. Thus, the new
sequence would be C1 C2 L1 L2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>L2 later &gt;&gt;</strong> shifts L2 one step later, so the new sequence would be L1 C1 L2
C2. While this may not be so common, it could be useful in some
situations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of choices available in this menu depends on the current sequence, and
on which side you are selecting to re-order.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Next</strong> or <strong>Prev</strong> buttons to navigate between the different sides in
this part</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Bends</strong> button to navigate down from the sides into the set of
bends for this side (this is the converse of the <strong>Side</strong> button in the
Bend panel that lets you navigate up from a bend to the side that
contains the bend).</p>
</li>
</ul>
