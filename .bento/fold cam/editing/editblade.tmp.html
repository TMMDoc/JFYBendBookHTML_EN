<p>The blade settings for each bend can edited by accessing the <strong>Blade Panel</strong>. To
access the blade panel for a particular bend:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Switch to that bend by clicking on the number in the fold navigator, or by
using <kbd>PageUp</kbd> / <kbd>PageDn</kbd> keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the standard blade, the ZBW blade or the ZBW blade carrier to open
the Blade panel</p>

<p>The blade panel is displayed as shown alongside. Here are the various settings
you can control from this panel:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Air-gap</strong> setting to adjust the air-gap. As the air-gap is adjusted from
its default value, the Fold Navigator will display a <em>non-standard
air-gap</em> warning. Collision checking will also be done immediately with
the updated air-gap and you can tune the air-gap to prevent
collisions. The bending force will also be computed, and if you set
the air-gap so low that the maximum bending force is exceeded, the
fold navigator will display this as an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Use ZBW blade</strong> toggle can be used to turn on or off the use of ZBW blades
for this bend. If the bend is too long, or no ZBW blades are
available, this may be greyed out (moving the mouse over the check-box
will tell you why it is greyed out).</p>

<h3 id="_zbw_settings">ZBW Settings</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>ZBW Settings</strong> header to open that section, if it is closed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Mount</strong> list to select if this bend should use a blade mounted on the
<strong>Left</strong> carrier, or the <strong>Right</strong> carrier. For bends that contain multiple
segments, you can also choose <strong>Both</strong>, to indicate that some segments are
processed with the left blade while others are processed with the
right blade</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Blade</strong> selector to pick one of the ZBW blades available for this
machine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Position</strong> selector to change the position of the blade along the
machine&#8217;s bending axis. For both blades, this position indicates the
location of the <em>reference edge</em> of the blade (the edge closer to the
back-gauge) along the machine&#8217;s bending axis, with 0 being at the
center. As you adjust this position, you can see the ZBW blade
immediately move, and the navigator at the top displays the current
status. These are the possible status indicators.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is possible the blade is slightly short of the bend span (5 to 10 mm
short). This is indicated as a <em>warning</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible the blade is more than 10 mm short of the bending span (the
bend overhangs the blade by more than 10 mm on one side or the
other). This is indicated as an <em>error</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is possible the blade collides with the part during the bending cycle; this
is indicated as an <em>error</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Length</strong> input to enter the length of the blade. It is possible to
create a blade mount that has multiple spans, separated by gaps.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click on the <strong>Clearance</strong> header to open that section, if it is closed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Insert</strong> clearance value to adjust the clearance between the ZBW blade
and the part as the blade is inserted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Extract</strong> clearance value to adjust the clearance between the ZBW blade
and the part while the blade is extracted (or moved to a different position
for the next bend). The image below shows how the clearance is measured

<p>The image above shows <strong>Both</strong> mounts being used. There is now an additional section
that allows you to enter the position and length of the second mount. The
<strong>Length 2</strong> setting has been set to <strong>95,-55,95</strong>. This means that there is a <strong>95</strong>
mm section of blade, a <strong>55</strong> mm gap, and an additional <strong>95</strong> mm section of
blade. Positive numbers are used to indicate blade lengths, while negative
numbers indicate gaps between blade segments. The measurements always
start from the reference edge of the blade carrier (the edge closest to
the back-gauges).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using this length input, it is possible to compose a blade with any number os
segments, separated by gaps. Note that the blade segment lengths are
limited to being multiples of 5 mm, while the gaps can be set at any
value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Note 1</strong>: The same notation (of using positive number for spans, with negative
numbers for gaps) is also seen in the tool-tip that is displayed for such
a multi-segment bend.</p>
