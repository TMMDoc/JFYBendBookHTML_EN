<p>The first bend in every side (or section) has a gauging position that is
computed automatically by JFY Bend. You can examine or edit this gauging
position interactively. To do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select the first bend in a section (click on the bend number in the fold
navigator, or use <kbd>PageUp</kbd> and <kbd>PageDn</kbd> to switch to that
bend).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the first bend in a section is selected, the gauges are visible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on one of the gauges to bring up the <strong>Gauges</strong> panel .</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The panel (shown alongside) has a few different settings and operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Slack</strong> is the extra opening between the gauges (this corresponds to the D Z1-Z2
parameter in the centering settings of the machine). This can be used
to open up the gauges slightly to make it easier to insert the part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Height</strong> is the amount the gauges are lifted up from the zero position during
the centering (the zero position places the flat surface at the corner
recess of the gauge at the bottom of the sheet). For some parts, it is
useful to adjust the Height to reference against the bottom part of
the back-gauges. As you adjust this, the gauge moves, and if it
collides with the part, the gauge and the offending surface in the
part are colored red. When such a collision happens, the navigator on
the top also updates immediately to show the offending bend in red.
(You can then open the navigator to inspect the reason for the error).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Auto-place</strong> is used to compute automatic positions for the gauges. This is done
for all the sides when you switch to the panel-bending mode. However,
after you have manually moved the gauge into some position for
experimenting, this button is useful to reset the position of the
gauges. In actuality, the gauges panel computes a series of
alternative positions for the gauges, and each time you click on the
Auto-place button, it displays the next feasible position of both the
gauges.
To get back to the first-recommended gauging position, close the gauges panel
(by clicking the X on the top right corner), click on the gauge again and
click on Auto-place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Next</strong> and <strong>Prev</strong> buttons are used to switch to the other sides in the part;
you can then edit the gauging settings for those sides. As you click
on these buttons you will see the part simulation immediately update
to display that side in the centering position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Gauge-X</strong> and <strong>Gauge-Y</strong> are used to fine-tune the position of the gauges
interactively. As you use these to adjust the gauge positions, the
gauges move and the collision status is updated.</p>
