<p>When you press <kbd>B</kbd>, or use the workflow panel to compute a solution,
{appName} calculates a bend solution using a set of default settings and parameters. You
can do a re-calculation of this solution using different settings by clicking
on the <strong>Recompute</strong> <span class="image"><img src="img/gear.png" alt="Recompute" width="20"></span> menu from the command bar. Sometimes, this is also useful to
complete the computation after you have interactively edited some tooling, or the sequence.<br>
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can change the sequence, and ask {appName} to compute new tooling stations while
keeping the sequence unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You could change the tooling stations, and ask {appName} to compute a new sequence,
or to align the part to the newly created stations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can try the tooling operation with a different set of tools, or try
using an already-created Setup.</p>

<p>This section contains some switches you can use to over-ride the default behavior of
{appName}.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Turn on the <strong>Don&#8217;t change sequence</strong> switch to force {appName} to compute a new
solution without changing the sequence. Different tooling stations, gauging positions
or part insertion directions will be tried by {appName}, while holding the sequence unchanged.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the <strong>No Angle Measurement</strong> switch is turned on, {appName} computes a solution
that performs no angle measurements, and will not use any gauging sensors (ACB tools)</p>

<p>The <strong>Ignore tools from GEO/DXF files</strong> tells {appName} to ignore the tooling hints
that are often found in GEO files, and sometimes in DXF file.</p>

<p><strong>Compute new Setup</strong> is the default behavior - {appName} will compute a setup using
all the tools it is allowed to (see the Tools section below).</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Keep existing Setup</strong> tells {appName} that no Setup changes should be made; it tries
to process all the bends using the current setup for the part. if some bends have collisions,
or have insufficient tool length for processing, those errors remain uncorrected, and can be
viewed after the recompute process.</p>

<p>The <strong>All Tools in Catalog</strong> is the broadest selection of tools; {appName} will use every tool
available in the manufacturer&#8217;s tool catalog to attempting a solution. While this may mean the solution
may not be actually feasible for production (using the inventory you have available), it is useful for
a speculative exploration of what tools would be required to produce a particularly complex part.
(In addition, this mode also tells {appName} to assume an infinite inventory of pieces - that is,
the optimum tooling is produced assuming you have an infinite number of pieces of each length).</p>

<h2 id="_sequence_priority">Sequence Priority</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When sequencing the bends in a part, there are a few potentially conflicting requirements. For example, should {appName}
try to minimize the <em>number of part rotations</em>, or should it try to minimize the bends where the <em>part&#8217;s
center-of-gravity lies inside the machine</em>? <br>
It is quite likely that each operator may have a different
set of priority rules, and also possible that different parts may require different priority settings.
{appName} therefore allows you to do a recomputation with a different ordering of priorities, using the
<strong>Sequence Priority</strong> section of this dialog.</p>

<p>Use the <span class="image"><img src="img/circle-up.png" alt="up" width="16"></span> and <span class="image"><img src="img/circle-down.png" alt="down" width="16"></span> arrow buttons on the right to shuffle the rules; items near the
top are higher in priority. You can turn some of these priority items off completely; this tells {appName} not to
consider this as a factor when deciding the sequence. (Sometimes, turning off some of these can yield a sequence that
uses few tool stations).</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid collisions during overbend</strong>: To achieve angle accuracy, most bends will need to be <em>overbent</em>
slightly to compensate for springback. This sequence rule tells {appName} to do bends in such an order that overbending
is possible. For example, in the part below, we should do the bend 1 first and bend 2 next; the other order would
block overbending.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t use low-priority tools</strong>: Tells {appName} to avoid using low-priority tools, or tools that are not in
the preferred list, as far as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid gauging on open angles</strong>: Gauging positions should ideally be in the same plane as the bend axis,
and there should not be any already-processed bends between the bend line and the gauging point. Here is an example
of a poor gauging that this rule tries to avoid:</p>

<p><strong>Avoid part tipping backwards</strong>: Especially with heavy parts, it is useful to avoid situations where the
center-of-gravity of the part lies behind the tool line. This rule tries to minimize such situations.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize part flips</strong>: Part flips are when the part has to be overturned (successive bends are in different up/down directions)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimize part rotations</strong>: A part rotation is when a part is turned left or right in the horizontal plane; this is
considered to be easier for the operator than a part flip; the default ordering of these last two rules tries to
favor part rotations over part flips, where possible.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="_footnotedef_3">
<a href="#_footnoteref_3">3</a>. {appName} uses some discretion about the part weight and how far back the center-of-gravity is behind the tool-line to consider this as a problem. Technically, it considers a part to tip backwards if there is a tipping moment of 0.15 Nm (Newton meters) backwards.
