<p>The workflow panel offers a powerful batch processing option that can be used to
process a large number of parts with a similar workflow. These are the
steps to batch-process a set of parts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a number of parts that should be processed with a similar workflow (you
can use the <strong>File &#8594; Open&#8230;&#8203;</strong> command to open multiple parts - just select all
the files you want to open, even if they are of different file types).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the workflow panel on any one of the parts, and process the part through
all the way to generating outputs (there could be multiple outputs,
for example a panel-bender program and a welding program).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the outputs are generated for this part, a new button called <strong>repeat</strong>
appears at the top right of the workflow panel. (This appears only if
there are multiple parts open already).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>repeat</strong> button brings up the Bulk process panel. This displays
thumbnails of all the parts that are going to be processed, along with
a brief summary of the batch processing operations that are going to
be done on these parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The image below shows the thumbnails of the parts (some of these parts are
loaded from 2D files, and some from 3D files). Click on the <strong>process</strong>
button to apply the workflow to all the parts.<br>

</li>
<li>
<p>After the processing is complete, the part thumbnails are updated:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parts that are correctly processed are in gray.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parts that were processed, but have some warnings that might require attention
are shaded yellow (NC code is generated for these parts).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Parts that could not be fully processed are shaded red.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>The image below shows the results after processing. Only some of the parts now
require attention, and you can close all the perfectly completed parts
by clicking on the <strong>Close Finished Parts</strong> link on the top-right of the
bulk process window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
