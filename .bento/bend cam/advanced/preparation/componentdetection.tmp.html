<p>Components such as nuts, screws, etc. do not normally require any
additional processing in this software. However, it is useful to
collect, detect, and use such components to generate a possible bill of
material of additionally purchased items that are required to compose
the assembly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are major differences in practice in how even a standard
component such as a <strong>M8</strong> screw is actually drawn. The software uses a
learning system which learns such component names based on the example.
At the beginning, {appName} does not know any standard components and
they are displayed in yellow (not identified).</p>

<p><strong>Variants:</strong> The same name as the name for an existing
component can be used. It is common for there to be different ways in
which, for example, the same M8 screw is modeled. If several components
with the same name are added, they become variants. Components with
several variants have their quantity listed after their name (e.g.: x4).
If one of these components is selected, all different variants can be
displayed.</p>

<p>All of these different variants have the
same name and the same ID. They are only depicted by different 3D
models. If the software detects one of these 3D models in an assembly,
this component will be marked with this name and this ID.
It is possible that two different
components with the same name have been grouped incorrectly. In such a
situation, the <strong>separate</strong> button can be used to separate the specific
variants with a new name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, if two components which
originally had different names are to be grouped, simply select one of
them and rename it so that it coordinates with the other one. Both are
grouped together as variants of the same component.</p>
