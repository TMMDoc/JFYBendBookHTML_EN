<p><strong>Show:</strong> All other forms which are already defined are also
displayed here. This form can be displayed as reference by clicking on a
name. To go back to adding the new form, you must click on <strong>NEW</strong> in the
top of the list.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Preview:</strong> Shows a preview of the selected form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Variants:</strong> The same name as the name for an existing form can
be used. This is normal as there different ways to model a form. If
several forms with the same name are added, they become variants. Forms
with several variants have their quantity listed after their name as <strong>Instances</strong> (ex: 3). If one of these forms is selected, all different variants can be
displayed.
All of these different variants have the same name and the same
ID. They are only depicted by different forms. If the software detects
one of these forms in an assembly, this form will be marked with this
name and this ID.
It is possible that two different forms with the same name have
been grouped incorrectly. In such a situation, the <strong>Separate</strong> button can
be used to separate the specific variants with a new name.
Conversely, if two forms which originally had different names
are to be grouped, simply select one of them and rename it so that it
coordinates with the other one. Both are grouped together as variants of
the same form.</p>
