<p>Starting with the opened drawing (2D/3D), additional
calculations are made based on the workflow. If, at a later point in
time, for example, a tool with other properties is used instead in the
bending process, this will have an effect on the existing geometries.
Using a corresponding presetting or working interactively, it
can be decided which drawings need to be adapted to the changes.</p>
