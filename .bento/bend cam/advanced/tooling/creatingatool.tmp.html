<p>{appName} can export bending tools as a DXF or
ARV format and can import bending tools from a DXF or ARV format.
All tools can be exported as a DXF format. However, only single
upper tools and single lower tools can be exported as an ARV format as
<strong>ARV version 4.15</strong>, no Z-bend, adapters or holders. More tool-ARV-files
can be imported than exported. ARV-import exceptions are complex special
tools such as e.g: hinge tools.</p>

Z-upper tools
For a Z-upper tool, a text with the following format must be

<p>Holders are configured in exactly the same way as an upper tool
adapter. However, certain holders, for example UT209/S, are also folding
tools which are used to press down a fold.
For these special holders, additional texts must be contained
in the DXF file:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The text SPLFLAVOR=Hem. Punch identifies the adapter as a
folding tool.</p>

for the correct simulation of the folding process. These parameters will
be marked in the image below as <strong>(A), (B)</strong> and <strong>(C)</strong>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first parameter <strong>(A)</strong> defines how far the flat vertical area
of the tool is located behind the bending line. In this case, the value
is negative, because the flat vertical area is located in front of the
bending line.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second parameter <strong>(B)</strong> defines how far the peak of the fold
is located in front of the bending line.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third parameter <strong>(C)</strong> defines the vertical clearance from
the punching peak to the folding peak point.</p>
