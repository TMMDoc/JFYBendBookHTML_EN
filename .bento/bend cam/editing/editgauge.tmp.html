<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Gauge</strong> selector to select the gauge you want to edit (you can also
just click on the gauge, and the panel is displayed to edit that gauge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Z</strong>, <strong>X</strong> and <strong>R</strong> inputs are used to adjust the position of the gauges
in three dimensions. For most press-brakes, the axes are as indicated
in the image below:<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup><br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/gauge-direction.png" alt="Gauge direction" width="204"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Surface</strong> selector is used to engage a different <em>surface</em> of the
gauging finger to the part. The set of surfaces available depends on the
machine, and not all surfaces may be applicable for all bends ({appName} will
inform you when a particular surface cannot be used). The image below
shows different surfaces being used:<br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/edit-gauge2.png" alt="Gauge Panel-2" width="736"></span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Retract</strong> setting is used to set the gauge-retraction distance before
bending. For some bends, the gauge has to be retracted (in the +X direction)
by some distance after the part is <em>pinched</em> by the punch, but before it is
bent (to avoid a collision). This setting is used to control the retraction
distance. When you are editing this, {appName} actually retracts the gauge by
the specified amount as a preview, so you can judge whether the retraction
may be sufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Auto-Place</strong> button to ask {appName} to compute a position automatically
for the specified gauge. In general, {appName} will have multiple gauging possibilities,
and repeatedly clicking the Auto-Place button will cycle through those
possibilities. To revert back to the <em>default</em>, close the gauge panel, click
on the gauge again, and then click Auto-Place - the first position then
selected is the default (that would also be the result of the original
auto-sequencing and tooling).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Flip Part</strong> button to insert the other side of the part into the
machine and compute gauging afresh. This is similar to the Flip Part
button in the <a href="EditBend.html">bend panel</a>.</p>

<p>Here are some more advanced operations with the gauges:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_editing_gauging_for_multiple_bends">Editing Gauging for Multiple Bends</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to edit the gauge positions for multiple bends at the same time.
To do this, first select multiple bends by <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> on the bend numbers in
the bend navigator. Then, click on a gauge. The image alongside shows the gauge
positions for bends 1, 2 and 4 being edited together:<br>
<span class="image right"><img src="img/edit-gauge3.png" alt="Gauge Panel-3" width="247"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the bends all use the same Z position for the gauge, and
editing this position will adjust the Z position for all the gauges. The X and
R position values are blank, since they are different for each bend. You can,
however, type in an X or R value and it will be applied for all bends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, you will rarely need to use this functionality. The gauge panel
is aware of the limitations of a particular press-brake and will enforce all
constraints required. For example, the R positions of the two gauges must be
the same for some machines (they do not have independent R1 and R2 axes) - {appName}
will ensure that when you edit the R position for one gauge, the other one is
also adjusted immediately to track.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For some machines with <em>2-axes</em> gauging systems, the Z positions of the gauges
are set manually, and are not typically changing from bend to bend (since that
would involve the operator having to manually adjust the gauges after each bend).
For such machines, when Z position is set for one bend, it is set to the same
for all bends. The collision status, gauge-engaged status etc are computed for
all bends immediately, so it is very easy to find common Z1 and Z2 positions
that may be acceptable for all bends.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_dragging_gauges">Dragging Gauges</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though the exact gauging positions can be set by typing in Z, X and R values,
it is often more simple to position the gauges just by dragging them into
contact with the part.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click once to select the gauge you want to drag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the selected gauge and drag to position it. Depending on the
<em>viewpoint</em>, the gauge is dragged along either a horizontal or vertical plane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, you start with the gauge away from the part, and drag it towards the
part until it touches. You can continue dragging further (pushing the gauge <em>into</em> the part),
and a <em>wireframe</em> will continue moving, but the actual gauge stops when it touches the part.<br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/drag-gauge.png" alt="Drag Gauge" width="768"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The image above shows this in operation - we start dragging the gauge towards
the sheet in the direction indicated by the arrow. As soon as the gauge touches
the sheet, it stops, and just a wireframe representation continues moving (to
show you where you are attempting to drag the gauge). This makes it easy to
position the gauge so it is just touching the part without any gaps, and without
any collisions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this image above, we are looking at the gauge from a viewpoint that is close to
<em>top down</em>. So, the gauge moves in the XZ plane, and the R value of the gauge is
kept constant. If you rotate the view to a more <em>end on</em> view, the gauge will
move in the XR plane, and the Z value will be constant.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_clamp_snaps_while_dragging">Clamp-Snaps while Dragging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By dragging the gauge, it is easy to precisely position the gauges when
you are using one of the <strong>Stop</strong> type surfaces. When you are using one of the
<strong>Clamp</strong> type surfaces, this is more difficult, since you have to engage both
surfaces of a clamping finger against the part.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>{appName} makes this easy by providing automatic <em>snaps</em> when the gauge is close
to a possible <em>clamping position</em>. To use this mechanism, first rotate the view
so you are seeing the gauges from top-down. Then, drag the gauges so the corner
you want to clamp fits near the aperture of the fingers:<br>
<span class="image"><img src="img/drag-gauge2.png" alt="Drag Gauge-2" width="768"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The image above shows a clamping operation in progress. As we drag the gauges
close to a clamping position, they <em>snap</em> into position at the Clamp 1 position
(see image above, center). Dragging further, the gauges then snap into the
Clamp 2 position (see image above, right). Note that the R value of the gauge
is automatically adjusted up or down as we move to these different clamping snaps.</p>
