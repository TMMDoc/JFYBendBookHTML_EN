<p>When you are editing a bend mount, you can click the <strong>Setup</strong> navigation button in the
tool mount panel to edit the complete bend setup. The Bend Setup panel is displayed alongside,
and there are a few operations possible here.</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can <strong>Save</strong> a setup to a bend-setup file (these are files with the extension <strong>.bsetup</strong>).
Later, you can use the <b class="button">Load&#8230;&#8203;</b> option to load this setup for use with a different part.
This is a simple, manual way to use the same setup for multiple parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Pack Station</strong> button appears if there are multiple stations in this setup, and
it can be used to <em>pack</em> those stations closer, while still avoiding any collisions
with bends being processed at adjacent stations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Center Setup</strong> button appears if the stations in this setup are not centered
in the machine&#8217;s available table area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Prev</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> buttons can be used to switch between different setups in
this part (if there are multiple setups).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clicking on the <strong>Mounts</strong> navigation button will take you down one level, to editing
the first <a href="EditMount.html">tool mount</a> in this setup (it is the opposite of the <strong>Setup</strong>
navigation button in the tool mount panel).</p>
