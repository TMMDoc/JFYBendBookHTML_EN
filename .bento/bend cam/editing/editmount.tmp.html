<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Bend Mount panel looks like the image alongside. The exact settings and operations
available will vary, depending on whether you are clicking on a punch, die or
adapter mount. In addition, some settings may be available or not depending on
machine capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Change Tool</strong> button to replace the tool used for the selected mount
with a different tool. (See the section below for more details on the <em>tool selector</em>
that is used to select a replacement tool).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Length</strong> input is used to adjust the length of the station. When you type in
a new value here, {appName} will compose the station again using an appropriate set of
<em>segments</em> to try and match the requested length as closely as possible. You
can visually inspect the segments being used by looking at the segment boundary lines
displayed on the bend mount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Position</strong> input is used to set the position of the <em>left edge</em> of the mount,
along the machine&#8217;s table or beam. The position can also be adjusted by <em>dragging</em>
the mount left or right. (See the section below on dragging the mount).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Ear</strong> selector (displayed only for punch mounts) can be used to force {appName} to
use the left and/or right ear<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> pieces in the composition).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>Flip Tool</strong> is used to flip the tool (front to back). It is displayed
when you are editing a mount that uses an <em>assymmetric</em> tool (like a gooseneck tool,
for example). The flip operation is intelligent enough to figure out if additional
holders and tools need to be flipped to maintain consistency. For example, in the
image below, flipping the OW_Z4 punch (used for Z-bending) also flips the die, the
holder and even the part to maintain process consistency:</p>

<p>The <strong>Add Adapter</strong> is used to add an <em>extender</em> to increase the height
of the punch or die. When you add an adapter, the adapter become selected and
the panel for the adapter is displayed (this allows you to change the actual adapter
being used, or to remove it).</p>

<p>The <strong>Add Gap</strong> is used to add a gap into the tool mount to allow a flange
to pass through without collisions (see the section below on Adding a Gap for more
details on this).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Taller tool</strong> is used to replace the selected tools with different taller tools from the same family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <strong>Remove</strong> to remove the tool mount. There will be a <em>missing punch</em>
or <em>missing die</em> error displayed in the bend navigator for bends that are using this
station, and this can be fixed by using the <strong>Add</strong> on the command bar on the
left to add a new mount.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>ACB Sensor</strong> selector is used to cycle through the different ACB sensor disk
pairs that can be used for this part. The selection depends on the sheet thickness,
and the punch being used.</p>

<p>When you edit a tool mount using any of these settings and operations, {appName}
immediately validates the status of all bend operations, performing various checks
like collision, tool usability etc. The bend navigator status updates immediately and
in real-time, making it very easy to experiment with various settings with immediate
and accurate feedback.</p>

<p>This window displays all the possible replacement tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use the hierarchy on the left to narrow down the choices - for example, you could
choose to display only Gooseneck tools, to make the selection easier.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Sort</strong> selector on the top to sort the tools by name, height, radius or
other sort criteria (the exact set of sort criteria depends on whether you are
replacing a punch, die or adapter).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can type in a tool name (or short-name) into the <strong>Search</strong> box to quickly
narrow down the list. Typing in a partial tool name is fine too - using <strong>OW200</strong>
for example will match both OW200, OW200/S and OW200/K tools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to adjust the sizes of the tool images. The tool that is
currently used has a blue fill and a thick outline. The light-blue cross-hatch
indicates <em>other tools</em> that are used in this part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Turn off the <strong>Filter</strong> check-box to have an unrestricted view of all tools (regardless
of whether they are suitable or not). In this view, the tools that are not suitable
are grayed out, and moving the mouse over one of these tools indicates <em>why</em> it is
not available for selection:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you move the mouse over the tool images, {appName} <em>immediately</em> re-computes the
selected tool mounts using the newly selected tool, and you can see in real-time
whether the tool you are considering will cause any collision problems or not (the
corresponding bends in the bend-navigator will instantly light up in red if there
is a collision). This real-time preview makes it very easy for you to experiment
with various tool choices until you find one that works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you <strong>click</strong> on one of the tools, the choice is made and the new tool is applied
to the part. If you press <kbd>Esc</kbd> instead, the preview choices you made are
reverted back and the original tool is left unchanged.</p>

<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Tool Station</strong> selector to select all the tool-mounts making up this
<em>station</em>. This will select all the punches, dies and holders that are aligned with
the selected mount, so they can all be edited or moved together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the <strong>Same Tool</strong> selector to select other tool mounts that use the same tool.
This is often useful before using a <em>tool change</em> operation; selecting all the
stations using the specified tool broadens the available selection of replacement
tools.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup></p>

<h3 id="_adding_a_gap_in_a_mount">Adding a Gap in a mount</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is sometimes useful to add a narrow <em>gap</em> in a tool mount, usually to allow a flange to
pass through without a collision. To do this, click on the <strong>Add Gap</strong> button (which appears if the
tool mount is long enough). A small section opens up in the panel, with a set of inter-linked
inputs to set the Left-margin, Right-margin and actual gap. Since the sum of these three must add
up to the tool mount length, editing two of these will set the third one automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The image below shows this operation in progress. We have a flange that collides with the punch,
and we adjusting the Left/Right margins until the proposed gap is aligned with where the flange
intersects the punch (you can see the proposed gap being displayed as two orange lines traced
on the bend-mount).<br></p>
