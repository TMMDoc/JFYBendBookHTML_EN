<p>Since JFY Bend has many integrated modules, there are often multiple <em>paths</em> through
which part data can move.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Example 1</strong>: when you load flat part data (from a GEO file or DXF file), you could
choose to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assign laser tooling to the part, so it can be placed on a sheet and cut,
along with other parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fold the part along the bend lines into a 3-D part, so it can be processed and
a bending sequence computed for a press-brake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Example 2</strong>: when you import a 3-D surface model (from an IGES or STEP file), you
could choose to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Analyze the surfaces and place 5-axis laser CAM tooling along holes that need
to be cut.</p>

<p>The <strong>Workflow</strong> panel is like a central hub from where you can direct all these
movements. When you have a part open, you can always bring up the workflow
panel by just pressing <kbd>W</kbd>, or clicking on the workflow icon in the
command bar on the left. Let us explore the workflow panel; start by
importing a 2D part with bending information (a GEO file, for example).
Bringing up the workflow panel at this point shows this:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We started with Bend_28.geo, imported and cleaned up to create a 2D
sheet-metal part (the part dimensions are displayed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is then a branch in the workflow.</p>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>We could assign Laser Tech to the part (this simply means assignment of laser cutting paths to the part contours).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could fold the flat part to 3D (9 bends are detected).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_expanding_workflow_nodes_stage_1">Expanding workflow nodes: Stage 1</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click on the Laser Tech icon to assign laser tooling to the part. You will see
the part is immediately analyzed and laser tooling is added to it. Then,
click on the Fold to 3D icon to fold the flat part into 3D. After these
steps, this is how the workflow panel looks:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/workflow2.png" alt="Workflow 2" width="698">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the annotations show, there are different types of nodes in the workflow
diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are Part View nodes representing the various types of processing one
could do on the part. Clicking on these nodes switches the part to
that <em>view</em> and the set of operations available on the part is
representative of that view. For example, in the Laser Part view, you
can see and edit the laser tooling assigned to the part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can switch between these view by clicking on these icons. All these various
part views also have short-cut keys, which you can see if you just point
the mouse at one of the view icons. Learn these short-cut keys to quickly
navigate through the workflow. So, after a while, you will be using key
sequences like <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>B</kbd> <kbd>Esc</kbd> to open the
workflow panel, switch to part to bending view, then close the workflow
panel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The part data is pushed between these nodes by various processes, and these
processes are represented in the workflow panel using the 13-pointed
star icons. For example, you move from the 2D Part view to the Laser
Part view by the Laser Tech process (which analyzes the 2D part and
assigns laser tooling to it).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processes you have completed have a check mark displayed inside them. Processes
you still have not completed (but which are available) have a cross
displayed inside. You can click on these process nodes to complete the
process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let us summarize what we can see at this stage of our partâ€™s workflow:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are 3 part views available now (the 2D Part, the Laser Part and the 3D
Model that we can switch between).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There four further processes available:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We could Post Process Flat Part (this generates a flat-part report that would
be useful to a laser or punch-press operator; it would typically
include laser cutting times, tooling setup for punch presses and
other special tooling requirements for this part).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could do a Quick-Nest (a quick-nest is a nest that contains only one type
of part) and generate a full-sheet packed with this part. This
could be used for producing a sheet full of just this part, or as
to assist in making a quick cost or time estimate for this part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could assign Bend Tech (press-brake tooling) for the part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We could assign Weld Tech (welding robot tooling) for the part.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let us go further: Click on all the available process nodes one at a time, and
see how the workflow panel expands. Keep going until you have no more
nodes left. Here&#8217;s how it should look after these processes :</p>

<p>In this fully expanded state, the workflow panel makes it easy for you to
instantly switch between six different views of the part in various
processing modules. You can also view and transmit or print all the
various outputs generated by these modules. (Outputs could be reports, NC
code, or time-studies).</p>

<p>The workflow panel represents a lot of information and operations in a compact,
graphical form. Much of the time, this will serve as your central hub as
you are working with parts. Let us look a bit more closely at some of the
icons in the work-flow panel to understand how they can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_available_process_nodes"><strong>Available</strong> process nodes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A 13-pointed star with a + inside it represents a processing step that is now
available. For example, it could be the folding of a 2-D flat into a 3-D
part, or assignment of laser-technology tooling. Hover the mouse over
such a node to display a tool-tip that explains what the node will do.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This follows a typical pattern for many Available process nodes. Clicking on the
node will execute the process with default settings. A <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> on the
node brings up a settings page first, and after you review/edit the
settings, the process is carried out. For example, here is what comes up,
when you <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> on the Quick-Nest node:</p>

<p>This is a typical set of options available on a completed process node. Clicking
the node brings up the process settings again, so you can tweak them and
try the processing again. A <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> option is also usually available to
delete the process data. If you choose this option, you are prompted
before the deletion is carried out. For example, here is what happens when
you <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> on the 3D Model node, for a fully processed part:</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many nodes have small icons near them, providing auxiliary commands. These
commands provide some functionality that is related to that node. Here are
some examples.</p>

<li>
<p>The auxiliary icons near each technology node typically allow you to select a
different machine and tool up for that machine.<br>

<li>
<p>The icon near the Quick-nest node lets you nest at a different sheet size.</p>

<p>Most processing in JFY Bend starts by importing CAD data (either 2-D or 3-D). The
JFY Bend parts that are built from this CAD data can continue to track these
source parts. When a part is opened, JFY Bend can check if the original CAD
file from which it was created has been changed in the meanwhile. If it
has, the part is now out-of-date and this can be seen in the workflow
panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can choose to refresh the part by clicking on the refresh part auxiliary
icon near the source part node. JFY Bend will re-import the CAD geometry
and rebuild the part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can also choose to stop tracking the original CAD geometry. This might be
useful, for example, if the original CAD file exists on a removable
medium or on a remote drive that may not be accessible in the future.
To do this, click on the break-link auxiliary icon near the source
part node. This will bring up a prompt to stop tracking the source
file:<br>

<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick summary of the principles in the work-flow panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The work-flow panel displays nodes representing various part views (such as
laser part, bend-part) and nodes representing various processes (like
fold-to-3D, assign-laser-tooling).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process nodes that are available (not yet carried out) are represented as
13-pointed stars with <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-plus-circle"></i></span> sign inside them. Process nodes that are
already completed are represented by stars with a <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-check-circle"></i></span> mark inside
them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clicking on an available process node invokes that process with default
settings. <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> on an available process nodes brings up an editor
to edit the process settings first, and then invokes the process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clicking on a completed process node lets you tweak the process settings and
apply the processing again. <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> on a completed process node
removes the processing data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The small auxiliary icons near a process node, or a part-view node provide
control to change some important parameter of that process node (such
as the target machine, or the nest sheet size).</p>
