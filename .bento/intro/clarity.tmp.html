<p>JFY Bend uses an innovative user interface design, code-named <strong>Clarity</strong>. When you are
working in JFY Bend, you are presented with an uncluttered, minimalist view.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the JFY Bend interface, you will <strong>not</strong> find:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Many rows of stacked icons, with only a small number being relevant to the current context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deep menu structures with dozens of menus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-interface <em>ribbons</em> take up a lot of space on the top of the screen.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, the Clarity interface works on the principle of <strong>Select</strong>, then <strong>Operate</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select things by clicking on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Clarity Panel pops-up, containing various <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Operations</strong> for the selected thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Panel often contains some controls for <strong>Extending</strong> the selection by selecting other similar things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Panel often also contains controls for <strong>Navigating</strong> among the various things you are working with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These user-interface principles are consistent across every working mode of JFY Bend. Whether you
are cleaning up a 3D model, arranging parts on a nested sheet, or editing press-brake
tooling, you will use the same set of key concepts. To make these abstract ideas
more concrete, let us take a small excursion and see the Clarity interface in
action (we will take examples from the JFY Bend report editor and from
JFY Bend to illustrate).</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a quick tour of how the Clarity interface works. There are just a
handful of simple concepts that are repeated everywhere in JFY Bend, and understanding
these concepts will mean that most of JFY Bend can be used without much reading
or training. In other words, if you read this section, you could skip reading
the rest of the JFY Bend user guide!</p>

<p>You can learn more about creating and editing report templates in a later section.
For now, let us introduce some report terminology so we can use this to
illustrate concepts of the Clarity interface.</p>

<p>The image above shows some of the types of entities that could be placed in a report.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Label</strong> is a simple piece of text; you can set various properties like the font,
text-alignment, and the color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Field</strong> displays some actual data picked up from the underlying Part.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Shape</strong> is some simple geometry (like an ellipse, rectangle, or line) that can be used to
add back-drops, highlights, or dividers in a report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <strong>Table</strong> displays data from the underlying Part that has a tabular form
(like a spreadsheet of information). In this example, we can see a list of bend operations
in this part, and some attributes are displayed for each of them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this basic background about report entities, we can now begin exploring the Clarity interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_principle_click_on_something_to_edit_it">Principle: Click on something to edit it</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Click on a Field, and a <strong>Clarity Panel</strong> is displayed (let&#8217;s just call this a
Panel in this discussion). Here&#8217;s an annotated diagram of how it could look:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/fieldpanel.png" alt="Field Panel" width="581">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking on a field selects it and displays a Panel for editing it.
Here are some of the elements we see in this panel:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The caption bar can be used to re-position the panel (you can click
anywhere on the background of the panel and drag it). If you set the <strong>pushpin</strong>
in, then panels always open at that location on the screen. Else, panels open
close to the location of the mouse cursor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit boxes, number input boxes, choice lists, font and alignment selectors are
all various ways in which the settings of the Field are viewed and edited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Action buttons are how various operations are performed on the selected object.
In this case, one could delete the field from the report by clicking on
the <strong>Delete</strong> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some Panels may contain many elements. To reduce clutter, the panels
are divided into sections, using <strong>Expanders</strong>. In the image above, you can see
the <strong>Visual</strong> expander is closed (hiding all the settings in that section), while
the Font expander is open. You can click anywhere on the expander to open or
close a section.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_principle_select_multiple_things_and_edit_them_together">Principle: Select multiple things and edit them together</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can select additional entities by holding down the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key when you click on them.
When multiple entities are selected, a Panel is displayed that allows you to edit
the settings of all of them at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/multisel1.png" alt="Multiple Selection" width="443">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the image above, we have 3 fields that we selected using the <span class="keyseq"><kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Click</kbd></span> mechanism.
The panel that is displayed allows us to edit the settings of all these three fields
at the same time. (Here we have the <strong>Visual</strong> expander open, and the <strong>Font</strong> expander closed).
After editing the <strong>Bgrd</strong> color and the <strong>Pen-width</strong> settings, here&#8217;s how the report looks:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/multisel2.png" alt="Multiple Selection 2" width="311">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The changes we made are applied to all the selected items. In this multiple-edit
scenario, note that the <strong>Expression</strong> setting is not displayed; this is one
of the settings that we are unlikely to want to edit together for a set of
fields (we would not really want 3 fields displaying the same value from the Part).
Settings which would usually have distinct values for each entity are not displayed
in such group-editing panels.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_principle_you_can_edit_entities_of_different_types_together">Principle: You can edit entities of different types together</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the example above, we selected three entities of the same type. What happens if
we select entities of different types? Let us see. First, here is how the panel
for a <strong>Shape</strong> entity looks:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/multisel3.png" alt="Shape Panel" width="398">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we select a <strong>Field</strong> and a <strong>Shape</strong> at the same time, this is the panel that is displayed:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/multisel4.png" alt="Field and Shape" width="395">
</div>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The caption bar now reads <strong>2 Report Items</strong> since we are editing report items,
but not of the same type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Only the common settings between <strong>Field</strong> and <strong>Shape</strong> are displayed (in this case,
these are just the settings in the Visual section).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_principle_multiple_selection_may_provide_additional_operations">Principle: Multiple selection may provide additional operations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the common subset of settings and operations available on multiple
objects, multiple selection may sometimes present new operations or settings
that are not available on individual objects. Let us take an example from the
bending view to illustrate this. In the bend view, clicking on a bend displays
a panel to edit the settings of the bend and perform some operations on it:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/bend1.png" alt="Bend" width="409">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The image above shows the panel for bend 3. Let us now hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd>
and select bend 4 as well. The panel that is now displayed looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/bend2.png" alt="2-Bends" width="410">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some settings that we can edit in common (the skip bending setting or
the station number setting). However, we see a new button here called <strong>Group</strong>.
Since two bends are selected, and these are collinear, they could be
grouped into a single bend operation. This is detected automatically, and this
new <strong>Group</strong> button is displayed; this operation is not available when just a
single bend is selected. Clicking on that button groups the two bends together,
as you can see in the image below.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/bend3.png" alt="Grouped" width="412">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, there are only 3 bend operations in this part. Also, bend 3 is now a
<em>grouped</em> bend and you see a new button appear: <strong>Ungroup</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_principle_use_the_selection_sub_panel_to_modify_the_selection">Principle: Use the Selection sub-panel to modify the selection</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Clarity panel will often have a <strong>Selection</strong> sub-panel near the bottom.
This panel provides some buttons to modify the selection in various ways.
Usually, there are buttons to select more objects that are similar in some way
or the other. For example, some ways to expand the selection would be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select all Fields in a report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select all polylines in the same layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select all punch-hits in a part that use the same punch tool.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select all bends that use the same setup.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example from the report editor of a selection panel being displayed
when we click on a Field in a report:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/selection.png" alt="Selection" width="303">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The selection sub-panel has a distinctive patterned background and rounded buttons.
In this example, you can see buttons to select <strong>All Fields</strong>, select <strong>All Bend Fields</strong> (fields related to bend CAM data), and <strong>Toggle</strong> (the current
selection set).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The actual list of selection buttons displayed in this sub-panel will vary
depending on the context. You will find that most common scenarios are handled
very conveniently by these selection buttons.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_principle_use_the_navigation_sub_panel_to_walk_through_the_entity_tree">Principle: Use the Navigation sub-panel to walk through the entity tree</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The set of entities in a part, report or layout often have a hierarchical structure.
We call this the <em>Entity Tree</em>. The structure is typically represented like an
upside-down tree, with the 'parent' object at the top and children below it.
Here&#8217;s an example of an entity tree in a report.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A report could have multiple items within it. Some of these items could be Tables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Table in a report could have multiple Columns in it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus, there are 3 levels in this tree, and a graphical representation of this
tree could be as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/navigate1.png" alt="Navigate" width="768">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This report has 2 Labels, 1 Field and 1 Table. The Table has 4 columns.
When we click on the table, we see a panel like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/navigate2.png" alt="Table" width="619">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The navigation panel provides directional navigation buttons to walk through the
entity tree. Like the selection panel, the navigation sub-panel has a distinctive
textured background, and appears at the bottom of the panel, but just above the
selection sub-panel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i></span> <strong>Prev.</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></span> buttons move among items at the same level of the entity tree.
Thus, clicking these buttons would select the other items in the report, such as
the <strong>Label</strong> or the <strong>Field</strong> items in the report.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clicking the <strong>Report</strong> <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></span> would move
up from the table to the parent - the <em>Report</em> itself. The panel that is displayed
when you click on the <strong>Report</strong> button shows some settings related to the report
itself, such as the paper size and the margins:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/navigate3.png" alt="Report" width="617">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we are editing the report; we are at the root of the entity tree. There is no
direction to go but down, and thus the navigation sub-panel has just one button (<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i></span> Items)
to go down to the list of items. Clicking this selects the table again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the table, the down navigation <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i></span> <strong>Columns</strong> button moves us down one
level and puts us in column-editing mode. This is what happens when we click
the <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-down"></i></span> <strong>Columns</strong> navigation button from the table panel:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/navigate4.png" alt="Columns" width="613">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The settings for the selected column in the table are displayed. Clicking the
<span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i></span> <strong>Prev.</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></span> buttons now moves the selection between the <em>columns</em> in the
table, since that is the level in the tree we are working with. There is
no down navigation button, since this is the lowest level in the tree.
The <strong>Table</strong> <span class="icon"><i class="fa fa-arrow-up"></i></span> button moves up one level, and we are
back to editing the entire table.</p>
