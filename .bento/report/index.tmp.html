<p>In addition to generating NC code, JFY Bend can also generate various <em>reports</em>
for a part, depending on the modules installed. When working with Bend technology,
for example, it is useful to generate a <em>setup sheet</em> that lists the tools
to be mounted, and provides details on the <em>bending sequence</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <a href="Designer.html">Report Designer</a> in JFY Bend helps you design the content and style of such
reports. Once you design a report, you can output the report to PDF or
HTML.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup> formats. Here is how the report designer looks like when it is
open:</p>

<h2 id="_using_a_report">Using a Report</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can open a report for editing by choosing the <strong>File/Open</strong> menu and picking
a report template file (these are files with the <strong>.ftrep</strong> extension). You can
find some sample report templates in the <strong>Samples</strong> folder of your JFY Bend installation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can open a report template to work with, you should first have a part
open, and you should have processed the part to completion (you should generate
the appropriate Bend/Cut/Fold technology data). This is because the report designer
works with <em>live data</em>; it shows actual data from the part as you design the report,
so you can immediately see what the final printed result will look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also start with a blank report by choosing the <strong>File/New/Report Template</strong> menu.
You can then populate the report by adding various <em>report items</em> (text fields,
images, labels etc) and then save it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have a report template open, you can use the <strong>File/Export to PDF</strong> or the
<strong>File/Export to HTML</strong> commands to <em>render</em> the report to PDF format, or to HTML format.
The report is printed using the data from the part that is currently open and active.
You can also switch the report between the <em>live data view</em> (the default) and a
<em>design view</em> that displays the underlying expressions that are used to populate the
various fields in the report.</p>

<p>You can set up JFY Bend to automatically print a bend report whenever a bending solution
is generated (just like it can generate NC code automatically when the solution is
computed). Use the <em>outputs</em> settings page from the Bend technology module
to configure this.</p>

<p>In the example above, the auto-generation of reports is turned on. The report
template is set to <strong>lib:Report/bend.ftrep</strong>, which is is the <em>default</em> report
template for bend CAM (it is installed as part of every JFY Bend installation).
If you create a different report template using the report designer, you can
specify that template here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The settings also allow you to control the folder to which the report is generated
and the format (HTML or PDF) in which the report is written.</p>

<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. The HTML files generated by the JFY Bend report writer are <em>self-contained</em>. They include all the necessary images, style sheets and other resources embedded right inside the HTML file. Thus, they can easily be transported or archived without any external dependencies.
