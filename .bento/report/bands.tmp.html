<p>A table is useful for some types of repeated data. However, sometimes, we may need to display
not just some text or numeric values in columns but may need a more elaborate display for
each element in the table (for example, we may need a picture, or even a sub-table). For
such situations, it is more useful to create a <strong>Band</strong> (this is sometimes called a
<strong>sub-report</strong>). When you click on some data source that could be represented as either
a table, or as a band, JFY Bend will ask you if you want to insert a Band or a Table:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/askband.png" alt="Ask Band" width="556">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>[Ask Band](img/askband.png)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you choose to insert a Band, an empty band is inserted (the shaded area shown below), and
the set of all the possible fields, pictures and tables that could be added to the band are
shown on the right.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/band1.png" alt="Empty Band" width="799">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now compose the data in the band by adding the fields, tables, and pictures from the
right. In addition to these, you can also add labels, static bitmaps or shapes (like divider
lines) by picking from the <strong>Sys</strong> data source. In this example, we have created a band for the
Part &gt; Bend &gt; Setup &gt; Mounts data, so each band is going to display fields, images and tables
related to one bend mount. After adding some elements into the band, the band may finally
look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="img/band2.png" alt="Composed Band" width="726">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We composed this band by picking some fields (position, length, flipped etc). We also
added the <strong>Name</strong> field at the top and changed it to use a larger font. Then, we added
a picture (the tool cross-section) and a table (the set of segments in this mount).
As we add these elements, the band displays live data for all of these, but only for
the first mount in the setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, when the report is actually printed, the entire band (with fields, pictures
 and tables) is repeated for each mount in the report. Here is a rendered example:</p>
