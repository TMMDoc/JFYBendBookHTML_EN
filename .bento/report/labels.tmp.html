<p>In addition to the data that comes from the part, reports may need some other
adornments - company logos, standard messages and simple geometric elements
like divider lines. These are accessed from the <strong>Sys</strong> data source.</p>

<h2 id="_inserting_a_bitmap">Inserting a Bitmap</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can add a bitmap (like a company logo, for example) by choosing Sys &gt; Bitmap.
Pick any image file to insert it into the report. It can then be resized or positioned
as needed. If you turn on the <strong>Link to File</strong>, JFY Bend will just store a <em>link</em> to the
image file in the report template. Else it will store a copy of the entire bitmap
in the report template.</p>

<h2 id="_inserting_a_shape">Inserting a Shape</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use the Sys &gt; Shape option to insert a simple geometric shape into the report.
You can set the background, fill and outline colors separately, and you can control
the outline thickness for the shape.</p>

<p>In addition to these simple shapes, you can also insert much more complex shapes
by reading them in from a 2D file (like GEO, DXF or DWG). Choose the <strong>From File</strong>
option in the shape, and then pick a 2D drawing file.<sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnotedef_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup>. All closed
outlines in the file are selected and filled with the selected fill color and
outlined with the selected pen.</p>

<p>Such shapes inserted from DXF and bitmaps often serve similar purposes. However,
the shapes inserted from a DXF file are <em>vector images</em> and scale very well, even
if the report is being printed at high resolution. On the other hand, bitmaps may
not scale well to high resolutions.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_inserting_a_label">Inserting a Label</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Labels are inserted automatically when you add a field or a table. However, you
can insert a standalone label (or any other fixed text) by choosing <strong>Sys &gt; Label</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These items (bitmaps, labels and shapes) are available for insertion even within
a sub-report or band. They are then repeated as many times as the band is rendered.</p>

<a href="#_footnoteref_1">1</a>. After the shape is inserted, the DXF/GEO file is no longer needed; the closed outlines from that file are improted in and stored as part of the report template.
